                        In this test, you are to imagine the folding and unfolding of pieces of paper. In each problem in the test there are some figures drawn on top and there are others drawn below. The figures on top represent a square piece of paper being folded, and the last of these figures has one or two small circles drawn on it to show where the paper has been punched.
